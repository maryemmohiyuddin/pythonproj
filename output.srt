Hello and welcome. Today we're going to be looking at how connecting with other people can help you with depression.

2
00:00:7 --> 00:00:12
And not just depression actually, lots of forms of mental health, it's something that is really beneficial.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
So why should we connect with other people?

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
Good relationships are really important for your mental health and wellbeing.

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
They can help you to build a sense of belonging, a sense of self-worth and help your sense of self-esteem.

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:31
Not only will it provide you with emotional support, but it could also be the opportunity for you to provide emotional support for others.

7
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
And that can make a real difference as well.

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:52
So in terms of looking at and building stronger and closer relationships, I would suggest, ideally, taking a bit of time each day to spend with family members or friends, whether that be a fixed time to eat dinner together, sharing a cup of coffee, having a break with workmates at the same time,

9
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
being able to have those conversations and have that closeness.

10
00:00:55 --> 00:00:61
Try and see if you can arrange a half a day or a day to spend with friends that you haven't caught up with all the while.

11
00:00:61 --> 00:00:73
You can make a real effort to turn off a TV, shock harrow I know in mobile phones, so that you can then interact more, whether that be playing a game with children or friends or family.

12
00:00:73 --> 00:00:83
The touch and it's the communication that really helps, rather than sitting there and mindlessly watching TV, which can benefit mental health in other ways.

13
00:00:83 --> 00:00:89
But generally, when we're thinking about connecting with people, we want those electronic devices really switched off.

14
00:00:89 --> 00:00:97
If it work, then it's a really good idea to see if you can establish a lunchtime routine where you can again have your lunch with other people.

15
00:00:97 --> 00:00:109
If you work from home, again, perhaps see if other people that are working from home would be available for a lunch of some store, even if it is a meeting the park or take it in terms to make that lunch.

16
00:00:109 --> 00:00:116
Perhaps think about visiting your family or friend that might actually need some help or support themselves. That can make a real difference.

17
00:00:116 --> 00:00:123
Perhaps friends and family isn't something that you've got a lot of. There are so many people out there that would really benefit from your company.

18
00:00:123 --> 00:00:130
You'll have a look at the local schools or the local hospitals or community groups. There's a whole heap of places that are looking for volunteers.

19
00:00:130 --> 00:00:138
And it could just be that, just to give somebody company and be able to be that person that provides conversation or a chat, then you could make a real difference to somebody.

20
00:00:138 --> 00:00:146
Obviously, technology can be really useful for keeping relationships going and creating bonds.

21
00:00:146 --> 00:00:152
And there's nothing wrong with using things like WhatsApp, Skype, FaceTime, video calls.

22
00:00:152 --> 00:00:163
You know, they can be absolutely fantastic. What can be detrimental is relying purely on social media or on technology to be able to give you that connection and relationships.

23
00:00:163 --> 00:00:176
So if you find yourself relying very much on technology or social media alone in order to build relationships, there's probably some better habits that you can get into that I've mentioned before that you could start to have a look at.
